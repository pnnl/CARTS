# tdg-benchs
Set of benchmarks used to test the performance of taskgraph. Growing

## How to Build & Run

### For benchmarks that do not belong to NAS
Firstly, set up the following environment variables (EV):
1. *OMP_PATH* : for TDG related builds, this EV needs to be set to the **TDG_INS**/lib, where **TDG_INS** is where the LLVM+Taskgraph toolchain is installed. Basically, Makefile uses this EV to correctly link the Taskgraph binaries. Otherwise, binaries using Taskgraph features will not be able to compile.
2. *MKL_ROOT*: for cholesky, this EV is specifically for Cholesky kernel. Since we call to MKL functions in it.
3. *OPENCV_ROOT*: for hog. Hog application needs OpenCV library to work, which is already comprised in its own folder. Hence, you can either set this EV to *tdg-benchs/hog/lib* or to your own opencv library folder.

Secondly, run `make` in the root folder of the current repository

Most applications have their corresponding runtime libraries set at compile time with rpath.
If not, please set the correct the library path by setting *LD_LIBRARY_PATH*.

### For NAS Benchmarks:
Access to the nas-omp folder and follow the instructions prompted by `make`. We 
need to specify the benchmark and the size to build.
